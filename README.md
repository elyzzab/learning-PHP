PHP programming
========

### Welcome :wave: and thanks for viewing my PHP code repository. These are examples of PHP code I've written for Codecademy's "Learn PHP" course.

#### For some files, initiate them in the terminal (bash shell) by typing 'php index.php', clear the terminal screen by typing 'clear', and end the program by hitting CTRL + C.

PHP programming
========

### Welcome :wave: and thanks for viewing my PHP code repository. These are examples of PHP code I've written for Codecademy's "Learn PHP" course.

#### In Codecademy: for some files, initiate them in the terminal by typing `php index.php`, clear the terminal screen by typing `clear`, and end the program by hitting <kbd>CTRL + C</kbd>.
